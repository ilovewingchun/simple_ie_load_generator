# simple_ie_load_generator

This simple bat is to generate load by launching IE to your URL, wait for 3 seconds, then close the IE window.
You will need to make IE as your default browser in order to work.
This bat will just generate a very small load and not causing overhead to client and server.
It will not stop until user CTRL+C to terminate the job or close the bat window.
It is also normal to see error. You just need to check if IE is really launching and get killed. 
Remember to change the URL to your own.
You can also open more URLs by inserting more "start" command. This will open more tabs in the same IE window.
