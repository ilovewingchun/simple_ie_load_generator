# simple_ie_load_generator

This simple bat is to generate load by launching IE to your URL, wait for 3 seconds, then close the IE window.<br>
You will need to make IE as your default browser in order to work.<br>
This bat will just generate a very small load and not causing overhead to client and server.<br>
It will not stop until user CTRL+C to terminate the job or close the bat window.<br>
It is also normal to see error. You just need to check if IE is really launching and get killed. <br>
Remember to change the URL to your own.<br>
You can also open more URLs by inserting more "start" command. This will open more tabs in the same IE window.<br>
